# Solar Panel Maintenance System

## Introduction
The Solar Panel Maintenance System is an AI-powered solution developed to enhance the efficiency and lifespan of solar panels while reducing maintenance costs. The project aims to automate the detection of abnormalities in solar panels, predict potential problems, schedule maintenance activities, and optimize their performance based on environmental and usage data.

## How It Works
The Solar Panel Maintenance System uses an array of sensors connected to an Arduino UNO to collect various environmental parameters, such as air temperature, humidity, irradiance, wind speed, and solar panel performance data. This data is fed into the AI-based machine learning model, which analyzes the information to detect whether the solar panels are clean or require cleaning.

The machine learning model is trained using multiple algorithms, including Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and Artificial Neural Networks. The best-performing model is chosen for the system based on comparative analysis.

Once the system detects dirty solar panels or potential issues, it schedules maintenance activities accordingly to minimize downtime and ensure optimal performance. The system can also adjust the settings of the solar panels based on real-time environmental conditions and usage data to maximize their energy output.

### Data Collection
Data collection is done using an apparatus with the following sensors and their purposes:

1. **Temperature Sensor:** Measures air temperature to assess its impact on solar panel performance.

2. **Humidity Sensor:** Measures relative humidity, which affects the solar panel's efficiency and potential cleaning requirements.

3. **Irradiance Sensor:** Measures the amount of solar radiation received by the solar panel, indicating its energy generation capability.

4. **Wind Speed Sensor:** Measures wind speed to assess its impact on solar panel stability and potential cleaning needs.

### Machine Learning Model
The machine learning model is trained using various algorithms, including Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and Artificial Neural Networks. The model analyzes the collected data to accurately detect abnormalities in the solar panels and predict potential problems.

### User Interface
The user interface is developed using the React framework and Material UI for a modern and intuitive admin portal. The portal provides real-time weather data captured by the sensor array, solar power generation information, and alerts regarding the need for solar panel cleaning or maintenance.

### Hardware Design
The hardware design includes an apparatus with a sensor array, an Arduino UNO, and air and water supply systems for thorough solar panel cleaning.

### Communication Protocol
The system components communicate through a central Django server. The server facilitates data exchange between the user interface and the hardware, enabling seamless coordination and monitoring of the solar panel maintenance activities.
